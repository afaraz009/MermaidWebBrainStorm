# Architecture Decision Document

_This document builds collaboratively through step-by-step discovery. Sections are appended as we work through each architectural decision together._

## Project Context Analysis

### Requirements Overview

**Functional Requirements:** ~41 FRs across 9 categories. Wave 1.1 (the binding
launch scope) includes all except FR31–38 (AI Generation = Wave 1.2, Code Connect =
Wave 1.3, which need design seams now but not implementation). Architecturally the
FRs cluster into four surfaces:
- **Workspace** (FR1–5, 12–15a) — live-syncing source editor ↔ Markdown preview ↔
  interactive canvas; command palette; minimap; pan/zoom; the Renderer Router that
  sends flowcharts to the native pipeline and all other Mermaid types to a
  viewer-only fallback.
- **Disclosure family** (FR6–11) — collapse/expand, focus, path, depth slider.
  Already built and spike6-validated on the engine harness; focus/path are pure
  IR-adjacency overlays, collapse re-runs layout on a derived IR.
- **Persistence, sharing, identity** (FR16–25) — anonymous-first session tokens,
  cryptographically random short-URL slugs, recipient-as-first-class-user (same SPA
  bundle), anonymous→premium claim, view/edit share permissions.
- **Account, premium, observability** (FR26–30, 39–41) — auth, hosted-checkout
  billing, export to PNG/SVG/PDF **with collapse state preserved**, custom branding,
  first-party analytics live before launch.

**Non-Functional Requirements:** 37 NFRs. The architecturally load-bearing ones:
- *Performance:* recipient cold-load TTI ≤3.0s and first-render ≤1.5s @200 nodes
  (the distribution-loop SLA); disclosure frame time ≤16ms p50 / ≤33ms p95 @200
  nodes; save→share-URL ≤300ms p50; 350KB initial-bundle budget (from renderer ADR).
- *Security/Privacy:* encryption at rest; ≥64-bit random slugs (no enumeration);
  noindex/no public discovery surface (hard privacy rule); argon2id; PCI SAQ-A via
  hosted checkout only; TLS 1.2+.
- *Reliability:* ≥99.5% save/load; issued share URLs never 404 except by owner
  deletion; anonymous diagrams persist ≥90 days; graceful degradation with in-flight
  edits preserved when the backend is unreachable.
- *Scalability/Cost/Maintainability:* absorb a 10× viral spike by configuration, not
  re-architecture; opex sustainable without revenue; automated build/test/deploy;
  full stack runnable locally in ≤30 minutes; performance budgets enforced in CI
  against 200/500-node fixtures.

### Scale & Complexity

- Primary domain: **Browser single-page application (developer tools)** plus a
  lightweight persistence / auth / billing / analytics backend.
- Complexity level: **Medium** — but the genuine technical risk (owned SVG renderer
  with Mermaid-faithful recursive layout + the 4-mode disclosure family) is
  **already built and spike6-validated**. Remaining work is largely conventional
  web-SaaS scaffolding wrapped around a finished, framework-less engine.
- Estimated architectural components: ~15–20 — the engine package, ~8–10 front-end
  shell modules, ~6–7 backend services, and the hosting/storage/monitoring infra.

### Technical Constraints & Dependencies

**Locked (not re-litigated this pass):**
- SVG renderer; Mermaid as **parser only** + `dagre-d3-es` + `d3-shape`; owned
  rendering pipeline; pin-and-recalculate drag; Position-3 hybrid (native flowchart
  pipeline + Mermaid viewer-only fallback for other types).
- SPA, not MPA; recipient pages hydrate from the same SPA bundle.
- Backend persistence from day one (no URL-encoded diagram state).
- Mermaid is the only diagram format in v1; Markdown is first-class.
- Desktop-first; mobile is viewer-only. Tier-1 browsers: Chrome/Edge/Firefox last 2,
  Safari 15+.
- First-party analytics only (no GA/ad-tech); transactional email only at launch;
  Stripe **or** Paddle hosted checkout (processor TBD this phase).

**Carried into the engine boundary:** the engine is plain TS mutating the SVG DOM
(no framework, no state library). It is embeddable under any front-end framework as a
pure `IR → SVG` function plus event handlers — `06-from-spike-to-product.md` proposes
extracting `spike6/src/` into a `@mermaidweb/render` package with a small public API
(`parseToIR`, `layout`, `renderFull`, `attachDrag`, `deriveEffectiveIR`).

**Resource constraint:** solo founder, weekend pace, coding-agent-assisted → bias
toward boring, well-trodden building blocks and low operational surface.

### Cross-Cutting Concerns Identified

- **Anonymous-first identity** — session tokens span persistence, sharing, claim-flow,
  and security; not an auth-tier afterthought.
- **Performance budget enforcement** — 200/500-node fixtures + frame-time/cold-load
  probes spanning engine, bundle/build, and hosting; a CI release gate.
- **Privacy/encryption posture** — default-sensitive content across frontend, backend,
  and infra (encryption, noindex, no gallery, SAQ-A).
- **Live-sync state** — single source of truth feeding source editor, Markdown
  preview, and canvas without round-trips.
- **Disclosure/collapse-state serialization** — must round-trip through the
  Diagram-Document model and the export pipeline (FR29).
- **Observability from day one** — analytics wired and verified before public launch,
  not retrofitted.
- **Engine-package boundary** — the seam between the finished framework-less engine
  and the chosen front-end framework (one of this pass's four open decisions).

## Starter Template Evaluation

### Primary Technology Domain

Browser **single-page application** (Vite + React + TypeScript) wrapping the
existing framework-less render engine, plus an edge/API layer on Cloudflare Workers
and a Supabase data plane. Not a meta-framework app (SSR rejected — see rationale).

### Starter Options Considered

- **Vite + React-TS SPA (`create-vite react-ts`) + `@cloudflare/vite-plugin`** —
  minimal, framework-agnostic base on the same Vite/TS toolchain the engine already
  uses; the Cloudflare plugin adds the Workers runtime + bindings (R2/KV/edge fns) and
  SPA-fallback routing in one project. **Selected.**
- **Meta-framework (Next.js / Remix / TanStack Start)** — rejected: PRD mandates
  SPA-not-MPA; all diagram pages are `noindex` (no SEO payoff); the SVG render is
  inherently client-side, so SSR adds a server render path with no benefit and more ops.
- **Opinionated React boilerplate (T3-style, batteries-included)** — rejected for a
  solo founder who wants deliberate, boring, minimal dependencies; we add libraries
  intentionally rather than inherit a stack.

### Selected Starter: Vite 8 + React 19 + TypeScript (SPA) on Cloudflare

**Rationale for Selection:**
- Same Vite/TypeScript toolchain as the engine → the `@mermaidweb/render` package and
  the app share one build/test pipeline (engine extraction stays seamless).
- React: largest component ecosystem (CodeMirror, cmdk, etc.) + best coding-agent
  training data for weekend-pace, agent-assisted build; bundle fits the 350KB budget.
- `@cloudflare/vite-plugin` 1.0 makes "SPA + edge Workers bindings" first-class in one
  project, serving the recipient cold-load SLA and viral-spike-by-config NFRs.
- Supabase as data plane keeps anonymous tokens, encryption-at-rest, RLS, and the
  anonymous→premium claim flow boring and fast to ship.

**Initialization Command** (versions current as of June 2026):

```bash
# Scaffold the SPA (Vite 8 / React 19 / TypeScript)
npm create vite@latest mermaidweb-app -- --template react-ts

# Add the Cloudflare Vite plugin (Workers runtime + bindings + SPA fallback)
npm install -D @cloudflare/vite-plugin wrangler

# Data plane client
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```

**Architectural Decisions Provided by the Starter:**

- **Language & Runtime:** TypeScript (strict mode), React 19, Node 20.19+/22.12+.
- **Build Tooling:** Vite 8 (Rolldown bundler); `@cloudflare/vite-plugin` for the
  Workers runtime in dev (`workerd`) and `wrangler deploy` to Cloudflare; SPA fallback
  via `not_found_handling = "single-page-application"`.
- **Deployment Target:** Cloudflare (static assets + edge Workers); Supabase for
  durable Postgres/Auth/Storage.

**Deliberately left open (decided in step-04 / step-05 / step-06):**

- **Styling** (Tailwind vs CSS Modules vs vanilla-extract) — base template ships none.
- **State management** (Zustand / Jotai / Redux Toolkit) for the live source↔preview↔
  canvas sync — base template ships none.
- **Editor & UI libs** (CodeMirror 6 for the Mermaid editor, `cmdk` for the command
  palette, a Markdown renderer) — added deliberately.
- **Data fetching** (TanStack Query over `supabase-js`) and the engine-package
  monorepo layout (`@mermaidweb/render` + app) — covered in step-06 structure.
- **Testing** (Vitest for unit, Playwright — already in the repo for engine
  verification — for E2E).

**Note:** Project initialization with the command above should be the **first
implementation story**.

## Core Architectural Decisions

### Decision Priority Analysis

**Critical Decisions (block implementation):**
- Engine extracted to `@mermaidweb/render` (React-free) behind a `DiagramController` facade.
- Diagram-Document data model: one row per *document*, source-of-truth = Markdown,
  `view_state` jsonb keyed by stable fence IDs.
- Identity & access: Supabase anonymous auth + uid-preserving claim; read-by-slug
  capability + RLS owner edit/delete.
- Backend topology: hybrid (direct supabase-js + RLS for CRUD; Hono Workers for the
  edge paths).
- App foundation: Vite 8 + React 19 + TS SPA on Cloudflare (from step-03).

**Important Decisions (shape architecture):**
- Hybrid React↔engine binding (controlled `view_state` + imperative commands).
- State: Zustand + TanStack Query. Routing: React Router v7 (SPA mode).
- Edge-cached recipient read path; encryption = Supabase disk-level + access control.
- PostHog analytics; Sentry monitoring; GitHub Actions CI with a perf-budget gate.
- pnpm-workspaces monorepo; Supabase CLI local stack for dev.

**Deferred Decisions (post-MVP or later trigger):**
- **Payment processor (Paddle vs Stripe)** — deferred; decide before the premium-tier
  build. Architecture stays processor-agnostic: a webhook Worker + a `subscription`
  state row.
- App-level field encryption — revisit only on enterprise/regulated demand.
- elkjs "Adaptive" layout (pluggable by design); sequence-diagram disclosure
  graduation (post-launch demand); mobile editor, version history / diff view (V2).

### Data Architecture

- **Source of truth = Markdown text.** One `documents` row per `/d/{slug}`. IR, layout
  coords, SVG, adjacency are always recomputed by the engine on load — never persisted
  (eliminates dual-write drift; matches the engine's derive-from-source model).
- **`documents`** (Supabase Postgres): `id uuid` · `slug text unique` (≥64-bit random,
  `nanoid(12)`/`pgcrypto`) · `markdown text` · `view_state jsonb` · `title text` ·
  `owner_id uuid null` → `auth.users` · `visibility` (`private`/`view`/`edit`) ·
  `theme jsonb null` · `created_at` · `updated_at` · `last_accessed_at` (drives
  ≥90-day anon retention, NFR-R3).
- **`view_state` (soft overlay), keyed by stable fence ID** (`id=…` auto-stamped into
  each ```` ```mermaid ```` fence, stripped before parse): `{ collapsed[], depth?,
  pins{nodeId→{x,y}} }` per block. Reconciled on parse — orphaned IDs dropped silently.
  Pins persisted best-effort; pan/zoom/focus/path are ephemeral.
- **Shared links open in the author's saved `view_state`.**
- **Validation:** shared Zod schemas (`packages/shared`) + markdown size cap; Mermaid
  syntax validated client-side (FR5). **Migrations:** Supabase CLI SQL, in-repo.
- No version-history table in v1 (diff view = V2).

### Authentication & Security

- **Supabase Auth.** Anonymous sign-in (FR16/17); **uid-preserving conversion**
  (`updateUser` linking email/OAuth) = automatic anonymous→premium claim (FR19);
  email+password (bcrypt default, NFR-S5); Google + GitHub OAuth fast-follow (FR26).
- **Sessions via `@supabase/ssr`** — cookie-based, httpOnly/Secure/SameSite=Lax, PKCE
  (NFR-S6). Authorization uses verified `getUser()`, never unverified `getSession()`.
- **Access control:** read-by-slug is a capability (unguessable ≥64-bit slug, NFR-S2)
  served via a `SECURITY DEFINER` RPC `get_shared_document(slug)`; edit/delete via RLS
  (`owner_id = auth.uid()`); `is_anonymous` JWT claim separates tiers; `visibility`
  gates premium share permissions (FR25).
- **Encryption at rest = Supabase disk-level AES-256 + RLS + unguessable slugs + TLS
  1.2+** (NFR-S1/S4). `noindex/nofollow` + robots exclusion on all `/d/*` (NFR-S3).
- **Rate limiting** on Worker endpoints (Hono middleware) + Supabase Auth limits
  (NFR-S6). Dependency scanning weekly (NFR-S9).

### API & Communication Patterns

- **Authed CRUD:** `supabase-js` (PostgREST) directly, secured by RLS — no hand-written
  CRUD API.
- **Cloudflare Workers (Hono), 3 endpoints only:** `GET /api/d/:slug` (recipient read,
  edge-cached with TTL + purge-on-write), `POST /api/webhooks/:processor` (subscription
  state → Supabase, service role), `POST /api/analytics` (first-party event ingest →
  PostHog, keys server-side).
- **Contracts:** shared Zod schemas type-check Worker payloads and the engine
  `ViewState`. Consistent JSON error envelope; client errors surfaced via TanStack
  Query. Optimistic UI on create/save/share (NFR optimistic), debounced save (~500ms).

### Frontend Architecture

- **Engine package `@mermaidweb/render` (framework-agnostic)** exposes
  `DiagramController` (`mount/destroy`, commands `focus/path/collapse/expand/setDepth/
  panTo/resetLayout/export`, events `viewStateChange/select/parseError/ready`). React
  binding (`<DiagramCanvas>` / `useDiagram`) lives app-side, extractable to
  `@mermaidweb/render-react` later. **The engine owns its SVG subtree; React never
  reconciles it.**
- **Binding = hybrid:** `view_state` is controlled (React holds canonical, engine emits
  deltas up, React debounces persistence); transient actions are imperative commands.
- **State:** Zustand 5 (client/UI/document — the controller can drive a vanilla store
  without React) + TanStack Query 5 (Supabase server state, optimistic).
- **Routing:** React Router v7 (SPA mode, `ssr:false`).
- **Editor/preview:** CodeMirror 6 (Mermaid editing, inline errors) + `react-markdown`
  (remark) preview; live flow = one text field → preview + debounced
  `controller.setSource()`.
- **Renderer Router (PRD seam):** flowchart/graph → native pipeline; all other Mermaid
  types → lazy-loaded full `mermaid` viewer (pan/zoom only, FR15a). **Code-split** the
  editor, the mermaid viewer-fallback, and elkjs to protect the 350KB recipient bundle
  (NFR-P1/P2).

### Infrastructure & Deployment

- **Hosting:** Cloudflare (SPA static assets + Hono Workers) via `@cloudflare/vite-plugin`;
  Supabase data plane.
- **Environments:** Supabase CLI local (Docker) → per-PR Cloudflare preview + staging
  Supabase → production. Secrets via `wrangler secret`; service-role key only in Workers.
- **CI/CD (GitHub Actions):** typecheck · lint · Vitest · Playwright (critical paths,
  NFR-M3) · **perf-budget gate vs 200/500-node fixtures** (NFR-P8) → `wrangler deploy` +
  `supabase db push`.
- **Monitoring:** Sentry (single error channel, NFR-M4) + Workers/Supabase logs +
  PostHog; retention ≥30 days (NFR-M5).
- **Scaling:** edge-cached recipient read shields Postgres; 10× spike = Workers
  autoscale + cache, with Supabase compute tier as the one config dial (NFR-Sc1/Sc2).
- **Repo:** pnpm workspaces — `packages/render`, `packages/shared`, `apps/web`,
  `workers/*` (detailed in step-06).

### Decision Impact Analysis

**Implementation sequence (refines PRD build order):**
1. Extract `@mermaidweb/render` + `DiagramController` (no behavior change); `packages/shared` types/Zod.
2. Perf harness: 200/500/1000-node fixtures + frame-time/cold-load probes → CI gate baseline.
3. App shell: Vite+React+Cloudflare scaffold, React Router, Zustand, `<DiagramCanvas>` binding; port the built disclosure family onto the package API.
4. Backend skeleton: Supabase schema + RLS + anonymous auth + slug + `get_shared_document` RPC; Hono recipient-read Worker with edge cache.
5. Workspace: CodeMirror editor + react-markdown preview + live-sync; command palette; minimap.
6. Premium: auth conversion/claim, share permissions, export-with-collapse, themes — **then** wire the (deferred) payment processor.
7. Analytics (PostHog) + Sentry wired continuously, verified before launch.

**Cross-component dependencies:**
- `view_state` shape is the contract binding engine ↔ data model ↔ export ↔ persistence — versioned in `packages/shared`.
- Fence-ID stamping couples the Markdown parse layer ↔ data model ↔ engine block identity.
- Edge-cache invalidation couples the save path (Supabase write) ↔ the Worker recipient-read cache (purge-on-write).
- RLS + `is_anonymous` claim couples auth ↔ every data access path.

## Implementation Patterns & Consistency Rules

### Pattern Categories Defined

**Critical Conflict Points Identified:** ~15 areas where independent AI agents could
diverge. Two are project-specific (engine conformance; the Postgres↔TS casing seam);
the rest are conventional. These rules are binding on every agent and every PR.

### Rule 0 — Conform to the existing engine (highest priority)

The `spike6/` engine is the seed of `@mermaidweb/render`. Agents MUST match its
established conventions and MUST NOT rename or "simplify" them:
- Module files: **kebab-case** (`parser-adapter.ts`, `effective-ir.ts`).
- IR/types: **camelCase** fields (`fromCluster`, `toCluster`, `originalPoints`,
  `labelPos`); types/interfaces **PascalCase** (`IRNode`, `NodeShape`).
- DOM hooks: `data-node-id`, `data-subgraph-id`; live data on `mountEl.__meta`.
- Edge identity: `L_<index>`; node `(x,y)` is the **center** (renderer translates to
  top-left). Edges are 4-point side-aware curves.
- The invariants in `docs/architecture/05-invariants-and-parity.md`
  (`fromCluster`/`toCluster`, `graph.children()` order, edge-id identity) are
  **inviolable** — changing them breaks Mermaid parity.

### Naming Patterns

**Database (Postgres / Supabase):** `snake_case`; **plural** tables (`documents`,
`subscriptions`); PK `id` (uuid); FK `<entity>_id` (`owner_id`); timestamps
`created_at` / `updated_at` / `last_accessed_at` (`timestamptz`); indexes
`idx_<table>_<cols>`; RLS policies `<table>_<action>_<audience>`
(`documents_select_owner`).

**API (Hono Workers, app-facing):** routes under `/api/*`, lowercase kebab, plural
nouns, params `:slug` / `:id`; **request/response JSON fields are camelCase** (see
casing rule).

**Code (TypeScript):** React components `PascalCase.tsx`; hooks `useThing.ts`; other
modules `kebab-case.ts`; functions/variables `camelCase`; types/interfaces
`PascalCase`; constants `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`; booleans `isX` / `hasX`.

### Structure Patterns

- **Monorepo (pnpm):** `packages/render` (engine), `packages/shared` (types + Zod +
  casing maps), `apps/web` (React SPA + its Cloudflare Worker), detailed in step-06.
- **Feature-first** inside `apps/web/src/features/<feature>/` (workspace, editor,
  canvas, palette, share, account); cross-cutting UI in `components/`, hooks in
  `hooks/`, non-UI helpers in `lib/`.
- **Tests co-located** as `*.test.ts(x)` (Vitest); Playwright E2E in `e2e/`.

### Format Patterns

- **Casing seam (the one rule):** **camelCase in TS, snake_case in DB.** The ONLY place
  mapping happens is a Zod transform layer in `packages/shared`. No ad-hoc mapping
  anywhere else; never let `snake_case` leak into app/engine code.
- **Worker responses:** success = the bare resource as JSON (HTTP status conveys
  outcome); error = `{ "error": { "code": string, "message": string } }` with the
  correct HTTP status. (Direct supabase-js calls keep Supabase's native shape, mapped
  via `packages/shared`.)
- **Dates:** ISO-8601 UTC strings in all JSON. **IDs:** uuid v4 internal; base62 slug
  (≥64-bit) external.

### Communication Patterns

- **Engine events:** the existing camelCase controller events
  (`viewStateChange` / `select` / `parseError` / `ready`) — extend, never rename.
- **State (Zustand):** multiple **domain stores** — `useWorkspaceStore` (doc/source),
  `useDiagramStore` (the controlled `view_state` ↔ controller bridge), `useUiStore`
  (panes/palette/theme). Immutable updates only, inside store actions; components read
  via selectors. No mutation outside actions; no cross-store reach-in.
- **Server state (TanStack Query):** centralized query-key factory in
  `lib/query-keys.ts` (`documents.detail(slug)`, `documents.list(userId)`); never
  hand-write key arrays inline.
- **`view_state` schema** changes go through the versioned schema in `packages/shared`.

### Process Patterns

- **Validation:** Zod at every boundary (Worker input, forms, `view_state` on
  load/parse). Parse-don't-validate; reuse shared schemas — no duplicate hand-written
  validators.
- **Error handling:** React error boundary per route; Worker errors → JSON envelope +
  Sentry; engine `parseError` surfaced **inline in the editor** (FR5). User-facing
  message text is distinct from logged technical detail.
- **Loading:** TanStack Query `isPending`/`isFetching`; skeletons on first load, inline
  spinners on refetch. **Optimistic mutations with rollback** for create/save/share;
  in-flight edits preserved on failure (NFR-R6).
- **Auth flow:** `signInAnonymously()` on first load if no session (FR16); convert via
  `updateUser` on signup (FR19); **authorize only with verified `getUser()`**, never
  `getSession()`.

### Enforcement Guidelines

**All AI agents MUST:**
- Read this section + `docs/architecture/05-invariants-and-parity.md` before writing code.
- Pass TypeScript strict, ESLint, Prettier — CI blocks on any lint/type error.
- Keep all DB↔TS mapping inside `packages/shared`; import types from there, never
  redefine DTOs locally.
- Add/extend Zod schemas in `packages/shared` rather than inlining validation.

**Pattern enforcement:** ESLint config + `tsconfig` strict are the machine-checkable
floor; this section is the human-checkable source of truth; violations are fixed in the
PR that introduces them, not deferred.

### Pattern Examples

**Good:**
- `const { ownerId } = mapDocument(row)` — snake→camel mapping via `packages/shared`.
- `queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: documents.detail(slug) })` after a save.
- `useDiagramStore.getState().setViewState(next)` driven by the engine's
  `viewStateChange` event.

**Anti-patterns:**
- `row.owner_id` used directly in a React component (casing leak).
- A second `interface Document {…}` redefined inside `apps/web` (DTO drift).
- Re-running full `layout()` on drag, or renaming `fromCluster`/`toCluster` (breaks
  engine invariants).
- Authorizing a request from `getSession()` (unverified) instead of `getUser()`.

## Project Structure & Boundaries

### Complete Project Directory Structure

The existing repo becomes the pnpm-workspaces monorepo root; `spike6/src/` migrates into
`packages/render` (git history preserved), and the harness HTML pages become the package
demo. `docs/architecture/**` and the planning artifacts stay as-is.

### Architectural Boundaries

**API boundaries:**
- **Client → Supabase** (authed CRUD): `supabase-js` (PostgREST) under RLS — list/rename/
  delete/save own documents (FR20/21), create (FR16), claim (FR19).
- **Client → Worker** (`/api/*`): recipient read, analytics ingest.
- **Worker → Supabase** (service role): `get_shared_document(slug)` RPC + webhook writes.
- **Webhook processor → Worker**: `/api/webhooks/:processor` (deferred processor).

**Component boundaries:**
- React owns the container + chrome; **`@mermaidweb/render` owns the SVG subtree** —
  React never reconciles it. Sole bridge = `DiagramController` (props in · imperative
  commands · events out). The engine imports nothing app-side; it never imports React,
  Supabase, or stores.

**State boundaries:**
- **Engine** = geometry truth (ephemeral, recomputed). **Zustand domain stores** =
  client/UI/document truth. **TanStack Query** = server cache. The controlled
  `view_state` is the only object that crosses engine↔store↔server.

**Data boundaries:**
- `documents` + RLS is the persistence boundary; `packages/shared` is the **only** place
  snake_case↔camelCase mapping and Zod validation occur; the `view_state` schema (versioned
  in `shared`) is the contract for engine ↔ persistence ↔ export.

### Requirements → Structure Mapping (cross-cutting)

- **Anonymous identity & claim (FR16–19):** `features/auth` + `hooks/useAnonSession` +
  Supabase anonymous auth + `updateUser` conversion; RLS keys off `auth.uid()`/`is_anonymous`.
- **Live-sync (FR1–2):** `features/workspace` orchestrates: editor change → `lib/markdown.ts`
  (parse + stamp) → `preview` re-render + debounced `controller.setSource()`.
- **Disclosure (FR6–11):** behavior in `packages/render` (built); UI triggers in
  `features/disclosure`; state via `diagram-store` ↔ controller `viewStateChange`.
- **Export with collapse state (FR29):** `features/export` reads current `view_state` +
  `controller.export(fmt)`.

### Integration Points & Data Flow

**Author save path:** edit → `workspace` → `diagram-store` (engine deltas) → debounced
TanStack mutation → `supabase-js` write (optimistic) → on success, Worker purges the
`/api/d/:slug` edge-cache entry.

**Recipient cold path:** `GET /api/d/:slug` (Hono Worker, edge-cached) → `get_shared_document`
RPC → document JSON → SPA hydrates → engine `parseToIR → layout → renderFull` →
author's saved `view_state` applied. Lazy-load CodeMirror / mermaid-fallback only if needed.

**External integrations:** Supabase (data plane), Cloudflare (edge/host), PostHog (analytics),
Sentry (errors), payment processor (deferred, isolated to the webhook Worker + `subscriptions`).

### Development Workflow Integration

- **Dev:** `supabase start` (Docker) + `pnpm --filter web dev` (Vite + `workerd` via the
  Cloudflare plugin → SPA + Worker together).
- **Build:** `pnpm -r build`; the Cloudflare plugin emits SPA assets + Worker; `packages/*`
  build first (workspace topo order).
- **Deploy:** CI runs the gate, then `wrangler deploy` + `supabase db push`; per-PR preview
  deploys point at the staging Supabase project.

## Architecture Validation Results

### Coherence Validation ✅

**Decision Compatibility:** All chosen technologies are current (June 2026) and mutually
compatible: Vite 8 · React 19 · `@cloudflare/vite-plugin` 1.0 · Supabase (`supabase-js` 2 +
`@supabase/ssr`) · Zustand 5 · TanStack Query 5 · React Router 7 · Hono · CodeMirror 6. The
`@mermaidweb/render` engine is framework-agnostic plain TS, so it embeds under React without
conflict. The Cloudflare-host + Supabase-data-plane split is a proven, well-trodden pattern;
the one cross-provider hop (Worker→Supabase) is shielded on the hot path by the edge cache.
No contradictory decisions found.

**Pattern Consistency:** The casing seam (camelCase TS / snake_case DB, mapped only in
`packages/shared`), the engine-conformance rule (Rule 0), and the naming/communication/process
patterns all align with the stack. The controlled-`view_state` binding is consistent across
data model → engine → persistence → export.

**Structure Alignment:** The pnpm monorepo (`packages/render`, `packages/shared`, `apps/web`
+ its Worker) directly realizes the engine-package boundary and the single-mapping-layer rule.
Boundaries (React owns container / engine owns SVG subtree; RLS as the data boundary) are
expressible in the structure as drawn.

### Requirements Coverage Validation ✅

**Functional Requirements (Wave 1.1):**
- Workspace/editing FR1–5 → `features/{workspace,editor,preview,canvas}` + inline parse errors.
- Disclosure FR6–11 → `packages/render` (built) + `features/disclosure`.
- Navigation FR12–15a → `features/{palette,minimap}`, engine pan/zoom, Renderer Router +
  lazy mermaid viewer.
- Persistence/session FR16–21 → Supabase anonymous auth, `documents` + RLS, slug, claim.
- Sharing FR22–25 → slug capability + edge-cached Worker read + `visibility`.
- Account/premium FR26–30 → auth/OAuth, themes, `controller.export` (collapse state), deletion.
- Observability FR39–41 → PostHog + analytics Worker, verified pre-launch.
- FR31–38 (AI, Code Connect) → correctly **seam-only** (Waves 1.2/1.3): premium auth +
  quota hooks land later; no architecture rework required.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- Performance P1/P2/P7 (cold-load, first-render, save→URL) → edge-cached recipient read +
  optimistic save + 350KB budget with code-splitting. P3/P4/P5/P8 → client-side engine +
  **CI perf-budget gate** vs 200/500/1000-node fixtures.
- Security S1–S11 → disk-level encryption + RLS + ≥64-bit slugs + noindex/robots + TLS +
  bcrypt + httpOnly cookie sessions + SAQ-A hosted checkout + 30-day deletion + weekly dep
  scan + (1.2) no-train LLM posture.
- Reliability R1–R6 → Supabase durability/backups, slug stability (no 404 except owner
  delete), `last_accessed_at`-driven ≥90-day retention, optimistic-with-rollback degradation.
- Scalability Sc1–Sc2 → edge cache shields Postgres; Workers autoscale; Supabase tier = the
  one config dial.
- Maintainability M1–M5 / Cost C1–C4 → automated CI/CD, ≤30-min local (Supabase CLI + pnpm),
  critical-path Playwright, Sentry, low Cloudflare opex.

### Implementation Readiness Validation ✅

- **Decisions** documented with verified versions; the four open decisions are all resolved
  (payments explicitly deferred with a processor-agnostic seam).
- **Structure** is concrete (complete tree, boundaries, FR→location mapping, data-flow paths).
- **Patterns** cover the conflict points including the two project-specific ones (engine
  conformance, casing seam) with examples and anti-patterns.

### Gap Analysis Results

**Critical gaps (block implementation):** None.

**Important gaps (track, non-blocking):**
1. **Payment processor undecided** — premium billing (FR27) cannot ship until Paddle/Stripe
   is chosen; the rest of premium (auth, claim, share permissions, export, themes) is
   unblocked. Seam kept processor-agnostic (webhook Worker + `subscriptions`).
2. **Performance is addressed but unmeasured** — NFR-P3/P4/P5 are validated only once the CI
   perf-gate + 200/500/1000-node fixtures exist (impl step 2). Carried risk from `docs/
   architecture/06`. The architecture *enables* the proof; it is not yet proven.
3. **Net-new (specced, not built):** command palette, minimap, Renderer Router, mermaid
   viewer-fallback — expected at architecture stage; flagged so they aren't assumed done.
4. **Subtle integration points needing focused tests:** edge-cache purge-on-write (NFR-R2,
   no stale/404) and `view_state` fence-ID stamping + orphan reconciliation (multi-block).

**Nice-to-have (later):** elkjs "Adaptive" layout, version history / diff view, app-level
field encryption — all deferred by design.

### Validation Issues Addressed

No critical issues. The important gaps above are documented with owners/triggers; the two
carried risks (perf unmeasured, comprehension thesis unvalidated) are product/sequencing
concerns surfaced from `docs/architecture/06`, not architecture defects — both are mitigated
by the front-loaded CI perf-gate and the pre-launch beta.

### Architecture Readiness Assessment

**Overall Status:** READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION (all 16 checklist items confirmed; no critical
gaps — the open items are a deferred payment-processor choice and an unmeasured-perf risk that
the first implementation steps are designed to close).

**Confidence Level:** High — the hardest, novel risk (the renderer/layout/disclosure engine)
is already built and spike6-validated; remaining work is conventional web-SaaS scaffolding
around it, with the residual risk concentrated in measurement (perf) and validation (thesis),
both explicitly sequenced first.

**Key Strengths:**
- Builds on a validated engine; the boundary keeps it framework-free and reusable.
- Minimal, boring, low-opex stack matched to a solo-founder weekend pace.
- Privacy/security posture (capability slugs, RLS, noindex, SAQ-A) is coherent end-to-end.
- One source-of-truth data model with a single DB↔TS mapping seam.

**Areas for Future Enhancement:** elkjs adaptive layout; sequence-diagram disclosure
graduation; version history/diff; richer multi-diagram canvas; app-level field encryption if
enterprise demand appears.

### Implementation Handoff

**AI Agent Guidelines:**
- Follow all architectural decisions exactly as documented.
- Use the implementation patterns consistently; obey Rule 0 (engine conformance) and the
  `docs/architecture/05` invariants.
- Respect project structure and boundaries; keep all DB↔TS mapping in `packages/shared`.
- Refer to this document for all architectural questions.

**First Implementation Priority:** Extract `spike6/src/` → `@mermaidweb/render` behind the
`DiagramController` facade (no behavior change), then land the perf harness + CI gate —
before the app shell and backend skeleton.
